A blog about energy, markets, science, start-ups, business, technology, and the intersection of business and technology...

At the edges of rationality, post-rationality, AI, X-risk, and effective altruism. Plus film, art, sports, gambling, and sports gambling.

Maybe even some views on programming, functional programming, serverless architectures, and Microsoft Excel.

If I'm ever not sure what to write about, I'll just make up some views about markets and pitch some costless-entry calendar ratios that are infeasible to put on in practice due to prohibitive bid-offer.

Based in Houston, Texas.
