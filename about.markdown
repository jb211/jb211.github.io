A blog about energy, markets, science, start-ups, business, technology, and the intersection of business and technology...

At the edges of tationality, post-rationality, AI, X-risk. Plust Film, art, sports, gambling, and sports gambling.

If I'm ever not sure what to write about, I'll just make up some views about markets and pitch some costless-entry calendar ratios that are infeasible to put on due to prohibitive bid-offer.

Based in Houston, Texas.
