I see some potential for chop and cosolidation. Thank you, and please tune in next quarter for my ever-changing views.

Alright but on the real, I took a whirlwind look around markets and while I do think Q4 will be pretty boring overall, enough markets are at some potentially interesting levels, where we could see some inflection points and setup for fireworks into 2022. If we are setting up for bigger moves in 2022, these types of turning points could take a couple months to sort out.

We'll start with what was likely the most important story of 2021 in my view, and what may continue to drive price action through year-end. The PBoC needs to start easing aggressively, and I think they will up their policy support in Q4. Since we've all forgotten by now, [they cut RRR in July](https://www.reuters.com/business/chinas-surprise-rrr-cut-gets-markets-pondering-rate-cuts-other-easing-2021-07-14/), and since then we've seen only further deterioration in China. The China-Tech decimation and Evergrande mess are all just symptoms of the PBoC remaining too tight. There have been a lot of ill-conceived comparisons of Evergrande to Lehman, with the same amount of hand-waving about shadow-banking and hidden leverage, (only now [somehow stablecoins are involved](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/21/evergrande-crisis-could-drag-down-tether-and-other-cryptocurrencies.html) whatever that means). *But*, there is one important similarity between Evergrande and Lehman--and that is the central bank could choose to render it a non-issue overnight if they so choose. Unfortunately, in the case of Lehman, the FOMC [made it an issue](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20080916a.htm), while after keeping FF's at 2.0% at the September meeting, started paying IOR 3 weeks later. And this after the ECB [hiked](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2008/html/is080703.en.html) at near ATH oil prices earlier in the summer.
