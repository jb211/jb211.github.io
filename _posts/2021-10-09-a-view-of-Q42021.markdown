I see some potential for chop and cosolidation. Thank you, and please tune in next quarter for my ever-changing views.

Alright but on the real, I took a whirlwind look around markets and while I do think Q4 will be pretty boring overall, enough markets are at some potentially interesting levels, where we could see some inflection points and setup for fireworks into 2022. If we are setting up for bigger moves in 2022, these types of turning points could take a couple months to sort out.

We'll start with what was likely the most important story of 2021 in my view, and what may continue to drive price action through year-end. The PBoC needs to start easing more aggressively, and I think they will up their policy support in Q4. Since we've all forgotten by now, [they cut RRR in July](https://www.reuters.com/business/chinas-surprise-rrr-cut-gets-markets-pondering-rate-cuts-other-easing-2021-07-14/), and since then we've seen only further deterioration in Chinese markets coupled with languising economic data. The China-Tech decimation and Evergrande mess are all just symptoms of the PBoC remaining too tight. There have been a lot of ill-conceived comparisons of Evergrande to Lehman, with the same hand-waving about shadow-banking and hidden leverage, (only now in 2021 [somehow stablecoins are involved](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/21/evergrande-crisis-could-drag-down-tether-and-other-cryptocurrencies.html), whatever those are). *But*, there is one important similarity between Evergrande and Lehman--and that is the central bank could choose to render it a non-issue overnight if they so choose. Unfortunately, in the case of Lehman, the FOMC [made it an issue](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20080916a.htm). And after keeping FF's at 2.0% at the September 2008 meeting, they started paying IOR 3 weeks later. And all this after the ECB [hiked](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2008/html/is080703.en.html) at near ATH oil prices earlier in the summer. 

Now, Evergrande is not Lehman, and 2021 is not 2008. But, it could be a little like late-2010/early 2011. We'll expand on this comparison, but to first close the loop on China: I think the risk-reward is tilted to getting ahead of potential PBoC easing in Q421/Q122. If one is inclined to go dumpster-diving in some Chinese names, we're at levels where it's not the worst idea. I wouldn't enter with a long-term view, but if you wanted to just try to scoop up some reversion points from oversold levels or perhaps try an expression of the long Chinese Tech/short US Tech pair trade that everyone got smoked out of this summer, we're at decent levels, especially after last week's encouraging price action in some of these Chinese names.

First, let's go through why 2021 is not 2008. We're seeing a curious spike in calls that we are in an [energy crisis](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-27/europe-s-energy-crisis-is-about-to-go-global-as-gas-prices-soar). And maybe Europe and the UK are close to crisis levels, they may see actual, phyiscal shortages of natural gas this winter. It could be quite bad there this winter. But I also can't speak with much certainity--simply because I don't live in Europe. I live in Texas. And I was gonna research some more into their situation this afternoon, but turns out I'm gonna be busy running the dishwasher, doing several loads of laundry, cooking with all burners in the kitchen simultaneously, all with my AC turned to 65. 

That was in poor taste. But really, here in the US, at winter *2022* HH strip all [below $4.50](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/energy/natural-gas/natural-gas.quotes.html) and front-month WTI kissing $80 only briefly, and still with a [deeply backwardated curve](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/energy/crude-oil/light-sweet-crude.quotes.html), we are *far,far* from an energy *crisis*. Now, I'm as big of a long-term energy bull as anyone. But at these levels, and energy sentiment feeling closer to a local top, this isn't a time to get worried about a full-on energy-induced recession. But it is time to worry just a little bit.

I saw a tweet the other day from a trader claiming how ridiculous it is that we are talking about an oil-price induced recession, claiming real rates are what really matter. On one hand, he was right. Energy crises really have deep *recessionary* implications only when they induce central bank mistakes. But to say oil prices are entirely meaningless is going too far. Recall Trichet hiked in 2008, and hiked *twice* in 2011 with oil back over $100. And look at the YoY change in headline inflation in 2008, 2000, 1990 (1st Gulf War spike), 1980, 1974 all while central banks had a bias to tighten. In the *best case* scenario, the Fed (for which I really mean global central banks) eases into an oil shock, just enough to stabilize nominal GDP. And stable NGDP in this case implies low real growth, with elevated headline inflation. Obviously not a great macro environment, but in this best-case scenario to an oil-shock, things would just suck for a while--then we'll be fine.

The issue is central banks don't like to ease into an oil shock, they like to tighten. (And ironically, Bernanke himself laid this out in a [1997 paper](https://www.brookings.edu/bpea-articles/systematic-monetary-policy-and-the-effects-of-oil-price-shocks/) .) And that's where we are today, even after a [weak/mixed headline NFP print last Friday](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/september-jobs-report-labor-department-hiring-covid-2021-191337923.html), consensus seems to still be a green-light for a November Taper. Again, this isn't 2008. But going ahead with tapering now could kneecap growth and yield a 2011-style risk-off sometime next year. 

Really, much of this is meta-level pontification that should be laid out in separate posts. So let's get to some markets, levels, and maybe even some trades. I read sentiment as bearish rates. I'd like to be long, but I wouldn't go knife-catching here. And if I were to pick a part-of the curve, I think a broad risk-off move would be a bull-steepener, with hiking premium in the 2024-2026-ish range getting yoinked first. EDZ5 could briefly breach 98.00, but I'd keep a close eye on if it could regain and hold 98.08. A more serious risk-off next year could yield a move back into the high 98s in my view.

And really, if there is to be a risk-off move in rates, it's also important to consider everyone's favorite currency pair that doesn't move anymore: USDJPY. While the yen has moved pretty closely with rate differentials this year i.e. with US rates, I think it's potentially at decent levels where risk/reward is favorable to try some knife-catching in the yen. And as risk-off hedge, being short USDJPY may potentially offer more juice than just being long US duration. FX vol is [low](https://www.reuters.com/business/dollar-finds-footing-traders-wait-inflation-numbers-2021-06-08/#:~:text=With%20recent%20trading%20channels%20tight,down%200.2%25%20on%20the%20day), so there's probably some high convexity, low theta option structure to be formed here. But just considering levels in a simple delta-one trade for now, it's a good spot to take a stab with very tight stops just above 113, with potential for a broader downside move below 100 sometime by mid-next year.
